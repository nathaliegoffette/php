# php

Welcome to my repository, I am a junior web developer in training at Be/Code and I am currently learning about php. 
This repository contains my exercices to learn php and has been created on januarty 10th and ended on january 16th.

#Who am I :
I'm a junior developer trying to get a good grip on php with projects and other things. I am currently in training at BeCode and do this as part of my training.


#What will you find?
These are mostly exercices, and are not really designed to be used.
So you will find php files with php trainings inside.
